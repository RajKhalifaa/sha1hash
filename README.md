# sha1hash
This script takes a SHA1 hash from the user and attempts to crack it by comparing it against a list of common passwords fetched from a URL. It prints each attempted password and indicates whether it matches the hash. If the password is found, it prints the password in green; otherwise, it informs the user that the password is not in the list.
